0x11. C - printf team project
By: Eunice Amable and Foster Asare

The printf project is a project that aims to create a custom implementation of the printf function in C. The printf function is a standard C function that is used to print formatted text to the standard output device.

The printf project is divided into several stages. In the first stage,we are asked to implement a basic version of the printf function that can print the following formats:

%d - A signed decimal integer.
%c - A character.
%s - A string of characters.
In the second stage,we are asked to implement the following formats:

%x - An unsigned hexadecimal integer.
%o - An unsigned octal integer.
%f - A floating-point number.
In the third stage,we are asked to implement the following formats:

%p - A pointer address.
%% - A literal percent sign.
